## _prev_tup()

1_000 iterations of _prev_tup in 0.816ms. The main thing we care about is not this little
private helper though, but PeriodCounter.inc(). Let's test that next.


## PeriodCounter.inc()

1_000 iterations of PeriodCounter.inc() in 7.766ms. We care about evaluation of some event more though. Let's
test that next.

## PeriodCounter.inc()

1_000 iterations of PeriodCounter.inc() in 29.593ms. (when 3 event-listeners are active). I'm not sure exactly
what a good performance would be here, but I can say the following: this means when a 1,000 events happen in a second,
the period-counter uses up 3% of the budget. A first guess would be: this is good enough.
