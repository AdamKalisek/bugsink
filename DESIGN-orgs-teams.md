Thoughts about teams and orgs

We don't provide a sentry-like concept of "teams".
You are on a project (as an individual) or not. If you're on the project, you're on that project's team.
I imagine typical levels of membership are read-only, regular (state changes of issues), admin (which can do settings and memberships)

Organizations: I think I'll have them: if you work at big-co, this is where you can set up your "bigger team", a place that may have multiple projects.
Examples: github, gitlab, cloud-foundry.
Also, once I build hosted.bugsink.com this is what I can give permissions to.
This may serve as a place for inherited permissions. And as a grouper for projects. And as a place for inheritable settings.
