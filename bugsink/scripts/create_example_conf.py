# some thoughts that I haven't been able to squish into a short comment yet:

# 1. regarding env-variables v.s. just using a conf file: we're not religious about Twelve Factor at all, but even if we
# were 12-factor says the following (which is basically what we do):

# > Another approach to config is the use of config files which are not checked into revision control, such as
# > config/database.yml in Rails. This is a huge improvement over using constants which are checked into the code repo,
# > but still has weaknesses: itâ€™s easy to mistakenly check in a config file to the repo; there is a tendency for config
# > files to be scattered about in different places and different formats, making it hard to see and manage all the
# > config in one place. Further, these formats tend to be language- or framework-specific.

# regarding the mentioned drawbacks: check-in is unlikely (this conf is owned by end-users, not bugsink-programmers) and
# scattering is not what we do: we have just a single file for the bugsink conf (though there are separate ones for e.g.
# gunicorn and nginx, but I'd argue that's a good thing)
#
# 2. when comparing with the auto-generated django settings, the SECRET_KEY that we generate here is less likely to be
# "automatically exposed", because it is not automatically part of the source code (checked into version control) of
# some piece of software. Still, people could check this file in, and you'd have an exposed key in that case.
#
# 3. regarding the sensitivity of this key, and storing it in the file system: I'd argue that if the server you're
# running bugsink on is compromised (and the file can be read) you have bigger problems (since the DB is also on that
# server)
